// Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.


// JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

// Block scope
// Function scope
// Global scope


// Block scope 

{

    let a=90;  // this makes variable locally or block scope  
    const b=80; // Even this
    // const is const in this block whereas let can be changed
    var c=98; // here c is globall variable 
    p ="Ajay "
}

console.log(c,p)
// console.log(a)
// console.log(b)





// Local scope 

// Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

// Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed



// JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

// Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

// Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.



function x(){
  let x=90;
  const y=987;
  var z=98;
   p="Ajay"  
//    when this function called it become global variable
//Oter wise not 
}
x();
console.log(p)
// No any variabale are accessed from out side 




// Global Scope
// Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

// Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

// Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block
