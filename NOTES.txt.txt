----------------------------------------------------------------
Before React js
====
1> HTML and CSS
2> jsx(javascript xml) and babel

It is the easiest way to add HTML code inside javascript or you can say
it is the extension of the Javascript language syntax.

jsx =javascript +html

babel
https://babeljs.io/en/repl#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&build=&builtIns=false&corejs=3.21&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=DwBwfAggVghgngAgcA9OIA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=env%2Creact%2Cstage-2&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.17.9&externalPlugins=&assumptions=%7B%7D

 Babel is a compiler that transforms HTML-like
 text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects

we can check in above link
-------------------------------------------------
3>
HTML Fundamentals of Javascript and ES6
Learn about operators, conditionals, functions,
loops, javascript keywords, array, objects, and other fundamentals.

Event handling, DOM manipulation, and how ‘this’ keyword works totally different 
in javascript (which is confusing for most of the developers).

Higher-order function, callback function, arrow function, state (how state and setState() function works) scope, class & constructors, extends and inheritance, map, reduce, filter, promises, modules, closures,
const, let (difference between var, let and const) and other features of ES5 and ES6



---------------------------------------------------------------------
4>
 Package manager (node +npm)
 npm =Node package manager

You can install NPM by installing Node.js.
When you install Node.js, NPM will install automatically. 

npm : manage all the files when we install and uninstall 
files 
it manages json and js files

everything when wehn we install or uninstall

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5> git hub  and CLI( command line interface)


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REACT JS 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note: React is not a framework.
It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.

It uses virtual dom to updating the 
content of webpages 


++++++++
jsx
++++++
it is javascript xml (javascript + html )

it is fater than normal javascript code 
it make easier way to code 

we write javascript code in curly brace { }

attribute we can provide in two way 
1 string literal 
2 using curly brace


ES ECMA SCRIPT 

it has many new key 
-----------------------
Babel

its is transcompiler 
 it convert hrml code int javascript  

It is a tool that is used to convert source code into another source code that is of the same level. 


 It is also good to note that a compiler is totally different from a transpiler as the transpiler converts source
 code into another source code at the same abstraction level, whereas the 
 compiler converts code into a lower level code generally
-------------------------
npm is node package manager 
it is used for package managing 

============================
REACT DOM 
============================

jsx is used to store the html in javascript code  


DOM statnd for document object model 

It is tree like structure 
it store all the content to display in the webpages  

and Each part is easy to update 
addding and deletion part  is also easy 

--------
The Virtual DOM can be referred to as a copy of the actual DOM representation
 that is used to hold the updates made by the user and finally reflect
it over to the original Browser DOM at once consuming much lesser time.
