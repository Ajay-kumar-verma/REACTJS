 

Antonio is given an array A of length N.

 

He is also given another array B of length M (M is even) where 1<=B[i]<=N. B may contain duplicate values. Using the elements of B Antonio make M/2 pairs such that every element of B is used only once.

 

Let S=0 initially. Antonio has a special love for even integers.

 

So for every pair (a,b) Antonio adds every even integer in A in range (min(a,b) â€¦ max(a,b)) to S.

 

For example if A = [1,2,3,4] and B[i]=2, B[j]=4, then A[2] = 2 and A[4]=4 gets added to S. A[3] is not added because A[3] = 3 is not even.

 

Antonio wants to form the pairs such that S is the maximum.

 

Help Antonio to maximize S.

 

Input Format:

 

First Line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of elements in Array A.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, denoting the array A elements.
The next line contains a single integer M, the number of elements in Array B.
The next line contains M space-separated integers, denoting the array B elements.
 

Output Format

 

Print the maximum possible value of S.
 

Constraints :

 

1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
2 <= M <= 10^5. M is even
1 <= B[i] <= N
 

Sample Input :


4
4 1 3 2
4
1 2 4 4

 

Sample Output :


8

 

Explanation of Sample:

 

Form pairs as : (1,4) and (2,3)

Initially S = 0.
For (1,4) : B[1] = 1, B[4] = 4. Even numbers in A in range [1,4] are A[1] = 4 and A[4]=2. So S+=2+4 => S = 6

For (2,3) : B[2] = 2, B[3] = 4. Even numbers in A in range [2,4] are A[4]=2. So S+=2 => S = 8

 

 

 

 

Things to Note for the Candidate:

 

You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.
The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.
Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output. 
Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement  (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
