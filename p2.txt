This time you have to implement a score calculation algorithm for Relevel tournament. In this tournament, there will be a total of N problems. You know that Alice has made a total of M submissions during the tournament, it will be given that i-th submission was made for Ai-thproblem and received the verdict Vi(Vi can be AC, TLE, WA, or RE).

 

The rule for the tournament are as follow Alice will get 100 points for a problem if she received AC verdict for the first time on that problem. If she received AC again for the same problem then nothing will change.

Alice will get a penalty and penalties is the sum of the following count for the problems on which she received an AC once or more: the number of TLE, WA, or RE received before receiving an AC for the first time on that problem.

Your task is to calculate the total points scored by Alice and the number of penalties.

 

 

Constraints :

 

1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= M <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= N
Vi ∈ {AC, TLE, WA, or RE}
 

 

Input Format :

 

The first line will contain two integers N and M, the number of problems in the tournament, and the number of submissions made by Alice.
Then each of next M lines will contain two things, first one is problem number Ai for which Alice has made the i-th submission and the second one is the verdict she received for that submission.
 

 

 

Output Format :

 

You have to print a single line that contains two integers separated by space, Alice’s total score, and the number of penalties.
 

 

Sample Input :

 

4 6

2 TLE

2 AC

2 RE

3 AC

1 WA

2 AC

 

 

Sample Output :

 

200 1
